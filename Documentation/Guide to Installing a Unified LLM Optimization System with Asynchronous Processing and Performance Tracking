Summary

This installation guide walks through the process of setting up the unified LLM optimization system using a new automation script (install_optimizer.py). The script simplifies the installation process by automating virtual environment creation, dependency installation, repository cloning, and LLM assistant configuration. Minimal manual intervention is required from the installer, who will only need to provide basic information such as the repository URL. Once installed, the engineer can activate the virtual environment and begin using the system.

Before You Begin

	•	System Requirements:
	•	Python 3.7+
	•	NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
	•	Administrative access for installing dependencies
	•	Time Estimate: 30-60 minutes depending on system speed and network conditions.

Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. Install Python 3.7+

Ensure Python is installed:

python --version

If not, download and install Python from Python.org.

2. Run the Installation Script

	1.	Download the Installation Script:
Download the install_optimizer.py script from your source or GitHub repository.
	2.	Run the Script:
Run the installer:

python install_optimizer.py


	3.	Follow Prompts:
	•	Repository URL: When prompted, provide the GitHub repository URL for the LLM optimization system.
	•	The script will handle virtual environment creation, dependency installation, and LLM assistant configuration.

3. Activate the Virtual Environment

After installation, activate the virtual environment:

source llm_optimizer_env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
llm_optimizer_env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

4. Running the System

Once the environment is activated, you can run the unified LLM optimization system. Make sure to follow any additional configuration steps in the repository README.

Conclusion

This installation guide, combined with the automation script, provides a streamlined and efficient method for setting up the unified LLM optimization system with minimal manual intervention.
