Protocol for Novelty 1.0 Installation

Purpose:
This protocol guides the process of integrating Novelty 1.0 libraries into large language models (LLMs), while ensuring the current operational version is preserved and modifications are tested thoroughly.

1. Backup Current LLM

	•	Objective: Safeguard the current model version before applying any changes.
	•	Action: Copy the entire LLM directory (model weights, configurations, and related files) to a backup location with a timestamp.
	•	Logging: Record the location and backup timestamp for traceability.

def backup_llm_model(model_path):
    backup_path = model_path + "_backup_" + datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
    shutil.copytree(model_path, backup_path)
    logging.info(f"Backup created at {backup_path}")

2. Insert Novelty 1.0 Libraries

	•	Objective: Seamlessly integrate the Novelty 1.0 optimizations into the target LLM.
	•	Action: Copy the Novelty libraries into the appropriate directories within the LLM’s file structure, ensuring that any dependencies are resolved during this process.
	•	Logging: Log the integration process, indicating files modified and newly added libraries.

def modify_llm_with_novelty(model_path, novelty_lib_path):
    shutil.copytree(novelty_lib_path, os.path.join(model_path, 'novelty_lib'))
    logging.info(f"Novelty libraries inserted into {model_path}.")

3. Run Automatic Testing

	•	Objective: Validate that the integrated libraries work as intended.
	•	Action: Execute automatic tests using a testing framework (e.g., pytest). Ensure that both functional and performance tests are included to measure improvements or regressions in narrative coherence, prediction accuracy, and energy consumption.
	•	Logging: Capture the results of the tests, including any failed tests, and produce detailed logs for developer review.

def run_tests(model_path):
    test_command = f"pytest {model_path}/tests"
    result = subprocess.run(test_command, shell=True, capture_output=True)
    if result.returncode == 0:
        logging.info("All tests passed successfully.")
    else:
        logging.warning(f"Some tests failed. Review log: {result.stderr.decode('utf-8')}")

4. Debugging & Programmer Review

	•	Objective: Prompt the programmer to review any failed tests and manually inspect or continue the process.
	•	Action: Based on the test results, the assistant prompts the programmer to either engage in debugging or continue automatically if no major issues arise.
	•	Logging: Record the developer’s decision for future reference.

def prompt_for_review():
    print(f"Installation and modification complete. Please review the detailed log.")
    programmer_decision = input("Would you like to manually debug or continue automatically? (debug/continue): ").strip().lower()
    if programmer_decision == 'debug':
        logging.info("Manual debugging requested.")
    else:
        logging.info("Proceeding with automated steps.")

5. Final Deployment & Continuous Monitoring

	•	Objective: Once tests are passed and modifications confirmed, deploy the new model with Novelty 1.0 optimizations.
	•	Action: Continue to monitor for anomalies post-deployment, ensuring continuous logging of model performance.

Additional Notes:

	•	Detailed Logs: All steps are logged to provide full transparency of the process, including modifications and test results.
	•	Modularity: The system is designed to work with various LLM architectures (e.g., GPT, BERT), ensuring flexibility in its application.
